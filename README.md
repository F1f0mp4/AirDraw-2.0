# 🎨 AirDraw 2.0 – Gesture-Based Virtual Drawing Interface

AirDraw 2.0 is an **AI-powered hand-gesture drawing system** built on top of [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).  
It empowers users to **draw, erase, and select colors** in mid-air — no mouse, no touchscreen, just natural hand movements.

## 🚀 Vision Statement
Reimagining human–computer interaction through **natural motion tracking** and **camera-based gesture recognition**.  
This project pioneers a **touchless creative experience**, merging **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **real-time rendering**.

---

## 🧩 Key Features
- ✏️ **Draw with your index finger** – intuitive single-finger control.
- 🤏 **Select color by pinching** – choose hues directly from the on-screen palette.
- ✋ **Erase with open hand** – go full-screen rubber mode with 5-finger gesture.
- 🌈 **Dynamic color palette** – real-time visual feedback for active color selection.
- ⚙️ **High-performance MediaPipe hand tracking** – accurate low-latency gesture recognition.
